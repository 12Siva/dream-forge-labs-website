                LoomEd is an ed-tech initiative designed to help students (grades 6–12) engage with AI as a tool for exploration and creativity. Our focus is on integrating AI into learning in thoughtful ways that encourage curiosity, reflection, and skill-building.

                        AI should assist, not replace. LoomEd is built around the idea that technology can enhance traditional reading and writing skills while keeping students at the center of the learning process.
